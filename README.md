# TI-89 PWA Wrapper

This repository provides a minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) shell that opens the [TI-89 Simulator](https://ti89-simulator.com) in standalone mode.  
The goal is to make it feel like a native app on iOS by adding it to the home screen.

1. Open your hosted URL in Safari on iPhone.
2. Share â†’ Add to Home Screen.
3. Launch from the icon to run the TI-89 simulator as if it were a native app.
4. (Optional) Clone this repo, host it as Github Pages, and use your own hosted URL to add app shortcut to your mobile device.
