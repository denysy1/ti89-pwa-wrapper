# TI-89 PWA Wrapper

This repository provides a minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) shell that opens the [TI-89 Simulator](https://ti89-simulator.com) in standalone mode.  
The goal is to make it feel like a native app on iOS by adding it to the home screen.

1. Open [TI89 PWA Wrapper](https://denysy1.github.io/ti89-pwa-wrapper) on mobile device.
2. Share â†’ Add to Home Screen.
3. Launch from the icon to run the TI-89 simulator as if it were a native app.
4. (Optional) Clone this repo, host it as Github Pages, and use your own hosted URL to add app shortcut to your mobile device.
